MOLD : Meta-variable Operations for Lean Development (CLI)
----------------------------------------------------------

Mold is a Template Processor, or Template Engine, to work with repository
templates. The main motivation of Mold is to have repositories in GitHub used as
template repositories to create new, customized repositories for other users.

Main features supported in Mold include variable replacement in files (*.mold)
or, recursively for all subdirectories, in all files (*.mold) of a given
directory; variable replacement in file names; inclusion of other templates;
definition of varaibles with a TOML file.

Variable replacement can be specified as 'normal', 'optional' or 'mandatory'.
For example, the variable 'foo = "bar"' can be with specified '{{foo}}',
'{{?foo}}' (optional) or '{{#foo}}' (mandatory). The difference is the handling
of errors when an undefined variable is encountered.

All template files must end with the extension '.mold', for example
'README.md.mold'. Destination files (with variables replaced) have the same name
without the 'mold' extensino: 'README.md'. This simplifies the work done in
large subdirectories with few templates.

This crate is a CLI tool based upon the Ada library. For more details about
the library and the tests, please take a look at the create 'libmold'.
